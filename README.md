## Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I am Alina!

ðŸŒ¿ I'm passionate about the intersection of technology and natural world, and I hope to bring a unique blend of scientific expertise and coding skills to the table. 

ðŸ§¬ With a background in genetics and experimental biology, I'm driven by the wonders of the natural world and the potential of technology to make a positive impact.

ðŸŒŠ After diving into the intricacies of natural sciuences, I discovered a desire to make a sustainable and meaningful contribution to the world. This led me to transition into the field of technology, where I hope to apply my skills to meaningful projects.

ðŸ’» Currently, I'm deepening my knowledge of programming languages like C and C++ (and more!) at the extraordinary [42 Wolfsburg](https://42wolfsburg.de), which provides a solid foundation for me to tackle complex coding problems and develop executive mindset.
